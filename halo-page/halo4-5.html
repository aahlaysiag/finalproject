					<h1 class="title medium">My Review</h1>
					<p class="body-text">I felt like this game was short. Not that I have an issue with it being short, it was a great, emotional game. I felt like the combat was a bit more difficult, but other than that. It was great. Intersting relationship between Cortana and Chief. 9/10
