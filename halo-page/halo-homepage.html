				<h1 class="title large">The Halo Series</h1>
				<p class="body-text">The Halo series was my second favorite series growing up in the 2000’s.
					Of course, Legend of Zelda will never be removed from the first, and Mortal Kombat is my third.
					Halo was my first FPS (first person shooter) game I had played as a child.
					My dad would play it more often than I would, and that’s how I grew to love it. 
					If he wasn’t playing Lengend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, it was Halo: Combat Evolved. 
					And I being the curious child I was, would sit with him and watch him fight of the covenant.<br> 
					<b>To summarize Halo, here is an excerpt from the Halo Facebook page:</b>
	
					<i>The Halo universe follows the story of a future war between humanity and a powerful alien enemy, the Covenant. 
					At its core, it is a tale about mankind’s desperate struggle for survival and its unwillingness to be swept aside, no matter what the threat. 
					This ideal is personified by the central figure, Spartan-117 - the Master Chief, a super-soldier who embodies the last force 
					that stands between the human species and its extinction in an increasingly hostile universe.</i>
				</p>
					<br>
					<h1 class="title medium">Disclaimer</h1>
				<p> 
					These are lists of Halo games I have personally played and finished. 
					I have not played Reach, or Halo 3 ODST yet. 
					As of April 2023, I am replaying the series through the Master Chief Collection, 
					and hope to play those two games and Halo Infinite soon!
