					<p> Halo 2 Anniversary Edition had some of the most beautiful cut scenes I had ever saw when it comes to the halo series. 
                        It starts off with the arbiter being tried for letting the first Halo ring being destroyed. 
                        In contrast, Sargent Johnson and Master Chief are being given medals for their bravery during Halo CE. 
                        I love the switch between Arbiter and Chief, and then eventually being able to play side by side towards the end.
                        <br> 
                        The interesting theme of politics within the Covenant is cool. 
                        Eventually being able to work with the Elites is awesome. 
                        Since Halo is deemed a “religious” symbol to the Prophets, 
                        and some of the covenant realize the prophets are lying, a civil war breaks. 
                        I believe that is the peak interest of mine for Halo 2. You see both sides of the coin. 
                        <br>
                        The true overall mission is to stir the halo from being launched and destroying the universe. 
                        The flood is just as horrifying as usual. So much so that Master Chief has to leave Cortana behind to deal with it.

					<p class="body-text">Halo 2 Anniversary was BEAUTIFUL. The cut scenes were very cinamatic. Blur did an amazing job. Switching from Cheif to Arbiter was interesting. You got to see both sides of the coin. The covenant you've been fighting since day one have a corrupt government, and deal with the same issues the humans do. They aren't just aliens coming to kill humans. They've been brainwashed. Awesome story and character building.  100/10
