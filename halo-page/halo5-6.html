					<h1 class="title medium">My Review</h1>
					<p class="body-text"> Apparently, Halo 5 was hated due to the gameplay and story changing. I enjoyed it, and just took the gameplay as the developers trying to try something new, while still keeping it natural halo. My only critque would be the advertisement, it was a bit misleading. But either way, it was still fun and had a great plot. 10/10
