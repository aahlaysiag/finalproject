					<p> Halo: Combat Evolved (the anniversary version) has a special place in my heart. 
                        It was the first game I ever played on Xbox 360, and is the main reason I have an Xbox One today. 
                        I hadn’t played the very first version of Halo CE, but my dad did when I was a lot younger and didn’t understand what was going on. 
                        The story line is great. It was much more than being Petty Officer John-117, aka Master Chief, and going around shooting aliens as some may assume. 
                        The combat felt easy, even now when I play the it on Legendary mode. 
                        It’s more strategy based. In summary, protecting Cortana, the Autumn’s artificial AI, is the main objective of the CE.

					<h1 class="title medium">My Review</h1>
				<p> 
					I will say, the horrifying scene of the first version of Halo CE, during the “The Flood” mission, 
                        had more an effect than the updated anniversary version. 
                        The dark atmosphere of the swamp made everything more creepy. 10/10
